This program organizes the folder you give it into 4 folders:
-a 'Pictures' folder for pictures in the directory
-a 'Code Files' folder for all the code files
-a 'Downloads From Terminal' folder for packages or libarys you downloaded from your computer
-a 'Others' folder for files that dont either 3 of the categorys mentioned above
It does this by making a COPY of the folder that you give it, and then reading all the file
names in that folder and organizing them according to their file extensions.
This program, currently, will work for macOS, Linux and Windows.
